    " # Module 2.2 Basic Visualization of Data with `plotnine`\n",
    "\n",
    " In this module, we will learn how to use the `plotnine` package to create basic visualizations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    " `plotnine` is a Python implementation of the 'Grammar of Graphics' that was originally developed in the R package `ggplot2`, which is a powerful and flexible visualization package. The grammar of graphics, is a theory of visualization that describes how to **build** a visualization from components. The grammar of graphics is described in detail in the book [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) by Leland Wilkinson. ([.pdf download here](http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/59587/1/41.pdf))\n",

    " ## The Grammar of Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    " The Grammar of Graphics describes a framework for construction a visualization as a mapping between data and aesthetic attributes (e.g. color, shape, size, etc.) of geometric objects (e.g. points, lines, bars, etc.). \n",
    " \n",
    " The grammar is composed of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gog.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Data**: The data to be visualized (usually a `pandas` `DataFrame`)\n",
    " - **Aesthetics**: The aesthetic attributes of the geometric objects. (e.g. color, shape, size, etc.)\n",
    " - **Geometriies**: The geometric objects that represent the data (e.g. points, lines, bars, etc.).\n",
    " - **Scales**: The scales that map values in the data space to values in the aesthetic space.\n",
    " - **Facets**: The facets that are used to split the data into subsets and plot each subset on a separate panel.\n",
    " - **Statistical Transformations**: The statistical transformations that are applied to the data before plotting.\n",
    " - **Coordinate System**: The coordinate system that defines the space in which the geometric objects are drawn.\n",
    " - **Themes**: The themes that define the overall look of the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    " Using these components, figures are built up in layers. For example, a scatter plot is composed of a layer of points, a layer of scales, and a layer of coordinate system. The grammar of graphics provides a *framework* for building up figures in layers."
