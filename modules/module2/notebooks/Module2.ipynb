    "## Classes and objects\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that it provides features that support object-oriented programming (OOP). Object-oriented programming brings together data and its behaviour (methods) in a single location (called an “object”) making it easier to conceptualize and understand. This reduces complexity and makes it easier to reuse code in different parts of a program or in different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for the object. It describes how the object is made (what data it contains and what methods it has). An object is an instance of a class. It contains real values instead of variables. You can create as many objects as you want from a class. Each object is independent of the others. You can modify an object without affecting the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a class\n",
    "Lets start by creating a class to hold a DNA sequence. We will need to define the attributes of the class, which are the variables that will be associated with each instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple class that only has a single attribute, the DNA sequence itself."

    "Now let's create an instance of our class. We do this by calling the class name as if it were a function, and passing the required arguments to the class `__init__` method. The `__init__` method is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class. The first argument of the `__init__` method is always the object itself (the instance of the class). By convention, this argument is called `self`. The other arguments are the ones that we passed to the class when we created the instance."
