    " These data is usually stored in files that are formatted in a specific way.\n",
    " Most of these file formats are designed to be easily parsed by computers, _and_ to be easily read by humans.\n",

    " For example, there are different file formats for storing nucleotide sequences,\n",

    " ### File formats for storing sequence information\n",
    " There are several different file formats for storing nucleotide or polypeptide sequence information.\n",
    "\n",
    " #### FASTA\n",
    " The [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) file format is a simple, \n",
    " text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences,\n",
    " in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using [single-letter codes](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html).\n",
    "\n",
    " A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description,\n",
    "followed by lines of sequence data.\n",
    " The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (`>`) symbol at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    " An example sequence in FASTA format is:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```\n",
    " >sequence1\n",
    " ATGCAGTACTGACGTATCGCATTCGTCATGC\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    " The first line in this example is the description, and the following line is the sequence itself.\n",
    " The description line is always the first line of a record, and must begin with a `>` symbol in the first column.\n",
    "\n",
    " The string following the `>` symbol is the identifier (name) of the sequence,\n",
    " and the rest of the line is an optional description of the entry.\n",
    "\n",
    " There should be no space between the `>` and the first letter of the identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    " The sequence ends if another line starting with a `>` appears;\n",
    " this indicates the start of another sequence.\n",
    "\n",

    " The [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) file format is similar to the `FASTA` format, but it also contains [quality scores](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_OLH_009008/Content/Source/Informatics/BS/QualityScoreEncoding_swBS.htm)\n",
    " for each base derived from the sequencing instrument on which a given sequence was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    " This is a common format for 'raw' sequencing data \n",
    " and the per-base scores are used downstream \n",
    " to help inform the alignment of the reads to a reference sequence (e.g. genome/transcriptome).\n",
    "\n",
    " The quality scores are usually represented as ASCII characters,\n",
    " with each character representing a calculated numeric score.\n",
    "\n",
    " The numeric scores are calculated by the sequencing instrument,\n",
    " and are usually a measure of the probability that the base call is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    " `FASTQ` formatted sequences also begin with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data.\n",
    " The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by an `@` symbol at the beginning followed by the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    " After the sequence, there is another description line\n",
    "  which is distinguished from the quality string by a plus (`+`) symbol at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    " Finally, the per-base quality string is included on the next line. \n",
    " his line must be the same length as the sequence itself, and the first character of the quality string corresponds to the first base of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    " An example sequence in `FASTQ` format is:\n",

    " (methods) in a single location (called an \"object\") making it easier to conceptualize and understand.\n",

    " This reduces complexity and makes it easier to reuse code in different parts of a program or in different programs.\n",

    " A `class` is a blueprint for an `object`.\n",
