The structure of most control flow elements in python is fairly similar: evaluate certain conditions/statements and follow this with a colon (`:`).  The subsequent *code block* is below this statement and always indented.  The block ends when the indentation ends. There are three types of control flow statements in python: `if`, `for`, and `while`.  Each operates a bit differently. "

Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of individual items (or operands). You are familiar with many of these, for example 5 + 3 = 8.
